        //Promise:
    // A promise a special javascript object that represents the eventual completion(or failure) of
    //an asynchronous operation.
    //It allows to handle asynchronous tasks more efficiently that callbacks 
    //Three States:
    //1). pending: The initial state, the promise is still waiting for the operation to finish
    //2). fulfilled: The operation completed successfully
    //3). Rejected: The operation failed

    //EXP:
    //1. To create a promise - new promise()
    //Two parameters-
    //resove ---- to mark the promise as succcessfully
    //reject ---- to mark the promise as failed

    //2. handling the result:
    //.then() method is called when promise is fulfilled
    //It will recevies the result from resolve()
    //.catch() method is called if the promise is rejected it receives the error message from reject()

    //Example:

    let mypromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true;
    if(success){
        resolve("Promise is resolved");
    }else{
        reject("Promise is rejected");
    }
    });
    mypromise
    .then((result)=>{
        console.log(result);
    });
    mypromise
    .catch((error)=>{
    console.log(error);
    })
